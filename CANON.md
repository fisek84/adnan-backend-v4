# CANON — Adnan.AI / Evolia OS (v2)

Adnan.AI is an AI Business Operating System.
It is not a chatbot, assistant, or feature-driven AI.

## Fundamental Laws

1. Initiator ≠ Owner ≠ Executor. This separation is absolute.
2. READ and WRITE paths are strictly separated.
3. No execution is allowed without explicit governance approval.
4. No component may perform implicit actions or side effects.
5. Every action has a real cost: time, authority, or resources.
6. Intelligence may advise, but never execute.
7. Agents execute tasks but never decide or interpret intent.
8. Workflows orchestrate state transitions, not execution.
9. UX reflects system truth and never invents state or intent.
10. If intent is unclear, the system must stop.
11. If approval is missing, the system must block.
12. No component may exceed the authority it can control.
13. No unbounded loops, autonomous escalation, or hidden persistence.
14. Every decision must be traceable and auditable.
15. Stability is prioritized over apparent intelligence.

## Design Constraint (Physics Rule)

The system must respect physical constraints
(time, energy, information, authority)
before attempting intelligence or autonomy.

Any violation of this canon invalidates the system design.
